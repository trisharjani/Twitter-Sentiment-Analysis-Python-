# Analysing 2 million Tweets using Python 

## Project Goals 
During my MSc, my thesis was focused on the broad goal of understanding why and how people choose to share information in a political context and how this is impacted by sentiment, whether a tweet is news and whether it endorses a campaign that the user supports. The investigative goals were as follows:
* To understand whether the sentiment of a tweet is correlated with the number of re-tweets and whether this is impacted by
    * A tweet being classified as 'news'  
    * The political affiliation of the tweet (i.e. whether users are more likely to re-tweet 
    
While this page contains a summarised version of my project, feel free to access the full thesis document [here](http://bit.ly/trisha_thesis) or alternatively watch this [video of a workshop I delivered remotely for the British Library] (http://bit.ly/britishlib_video) for students looking to conduct research projects using social media data 

## Project Tools 
To do this, I used a publicly available dataset containing Twitter data which you may download [here](https://catalog.docnow.io/) titled "Ireland 8th amendment referendum vote". Alternatively, the .txt file is also included in repository. I chose to use Python given its ease to work with and R/ R Studio's speed limitations in processing big data. Writing in Python 3.5, I used Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda employing the following packages during the analysis. Feel free to access the full script [here](). 

* Numpy 
* Pandas 
* Seaborn

## Data Cleaning & Simple Classification 

*1. Removing all spam tweets* 

*2. Assigning Tweet a Partisan or 'Endorsement' Value from -1 to 1* 

*3. Assigning Tweets a Sentiment* 

*4. Filtering by Users of Importance*
