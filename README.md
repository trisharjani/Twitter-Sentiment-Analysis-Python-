# Analysing 2 million Tweets using Python 

## Project Goals 
During my MSc, my thesis was focused on the broad goal of understanding why and how people choose to share information in a political context and how this is impacted by sentiment, whether a tweet is news and whether it endorses a campaign that the user supports. The investigative goals were as follows:
* To understand whether the sentiment of a tweet is correlated with the number of re-tweets and whether this is impacted by
    * A tweet being classified as 'news'  
    * The political affiliation of the tweet (i.e. whether users are more likely to re-tweet 

## Project Tools 
To do this, I used a publicly available dataset containing Twitter data, available [here]: https://catalog.docnow.io/ titled "Ireland 8th amendment referendum vote" and chose to use Python given its ease to work with and R/ R Studio's speed limitations in processing big data. Writing in Python 3.5, I used Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda employing the following packages during the analysis. Feel free to access the script [here]:  

* Numpy 
* Pandas 
* Seaborn
